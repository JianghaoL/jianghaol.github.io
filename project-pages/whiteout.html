          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Whiteout is an innovative 3D adventure game that explores themes of alienation and self-discovery.
            The game is completed in 48 hours as part of a game jam event.
          </p>
          <p>
            We aimed to create an immersive experience where players navigate through a surreal environment,
            solving puzzles and uncovering the protagonist's story.
            We focused on atmospheric design, combining visual aesthetics with a haunting soundtrack to enhance the emotional impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            I designed the core gameplay mechanics, implemented such simulations, and composed the game's soundtrack to complement the narrative.
            The game was collaboratively developed with Aerina Fu, Dayuan Dong, Yuxiang Wang, and Kairui Xu.

            <h2>Design and Concepts</h2>
            <p>
              The game was developed for a 48 hour game jam, whose theme was "Mask".
              We brainstormed various ideas and finally settled on the idea where we 
              interpret "Mask" both as an emotional mask that people wear to hide their true selves, and
              as a way to shield oneself from the harsh realities of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              I led the conversation and the brainstorming session, and proposed the idea of an adventure game
              where the player explores a surreal world while uncovering the protagonist's story.
              We thus decided that our experience goal was to make player feel isolated but cured in the end.
            </p>
            <p>
              To achieve the feeling of isolation and alienation, we designed the core mechanics of the game,
              one of which was that the player needs to avoid light sources in the environment, as they represent societal pressures
              that the protagonist is trying to escape from.
              We also designed a unique mechanic where the player can throw ink to create a temporary shield against light,
              symbolizing the emotional masks people wear.

            <h2>Light Check</h2>
            <p>
              One of the main mechanics of the game is to avoid light sources.
              While there were many ways to implement this, one of which we considered was to use shader
              programming to check the brightness of the pixel where the player is located, we thought that
              it would be too challenging to implement within the time constraint of a 48-hour game jam.
              Instead, I proposed a simpler yet effective method to achieve this.
            </p>
            <p>
              By design, the game has only one directional light source in any given scene, which made the implementation
              much easier. I set up a system that constantly sends out a ray from the light source's position to that of the player,
              and check if the ray hits any obstacle before reaching the player.
            </p>

              The light manager singleton handles all light sources in the scene.
              In the Update function, it iterates through all light sources and performs their respective execution logic.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the execution logic returns true, it means that the player is exposed to that light source,
              and light manager will invoke an event to notify other systems, such as the player handler to hanle the consequences.
              On the other hand, if no light source exposes the player, another event is invoked to notify that the player is safe.

            <p>
              Although in the current version of the game, there is only one light source,
              we specifically designed the light system to be easily extendable to support multiple light sources in the future.
              To achieve this, we created a base class for light sources, which serves a common interface.
              All light sources inherit from this base class and implement their own execution logic if needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              As is shown in the code snippet, the base class provides a virtual Execute method, which allows
              derived classes to override it with their specific logic.

            <h2>Ink Throwing</h2>
            <p>
              Another core and innovative mechanic of the game is the ink throwing mechanic, where the player can throw ink to create a temporary shield against light.
              This mechanic is designed to symbolize the emotional masks people wear to protect themselves from societal pressures.
            </p>
            <p>
              As we designed, the player could pick up ink from certain locations in the environment. By throwing the ink, the player
              creates a splash of ink at the target location, which serves as a safe zone that will prevents
              the player from being exposed to light sources when they are within the ink area.

            <p>
              We used the decal system in Unity to create the ink splash effect. When the player throws ink, a decal is instantiated at the target location, which creates a circular area that blocks light.
              The decal will render on top of the environment and characters, creating a visually distinct safe zone for the player. 
            </p>
            <p>
              A trigger collider zone is set up so that when the player enters, stays, or exits the ink area, the light manager will be notified to update the player's exposure status accordingly.

            <h2>Trajectory</h2>
            <p>
              To enhance the gameplay experience of the ink throwing mechanic, we implemented a trajectory prediction system to help players aim their throws more accurately.
              When the player is aiming the throw, a trajectory line is rendered from the player's position to the target location, showing the predicted path of the ink splash.
            </p>
            <p>
              We created a static class for trajectory calculation, which uses physics equations to calculate the trajectory points based on the initial velocity and gravity.
              The trajectory line is updated in real-time as the player adjusts their aim, providing immediate feedback on where the ink will land.
